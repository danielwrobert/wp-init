# WP-Init

A set of WP-CLI commands I frequently run to start up a new WP project.

## Usage

Add this script to the directory you wish to install your WP project, execute it (`sh wp-init.sh`), and follow the prompts!

This script assumes you have [WP-CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/) setup and configured.
