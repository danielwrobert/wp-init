# WP-Init

A set of WP-CLI commands I frequently run to start up a new WP project.

## Usage

Add this script to the directory you wish to install your WP project and run the following command:

```
sh wp-init.sh <PROJECT DIRECTORY NAME> <SITE TITLE> <USER EMAIL> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
```

Note that if you have spaces in any of the above arguments, you need to wrap that argument in single quotes.

For the time being, the directory name and the database name will be the same.
